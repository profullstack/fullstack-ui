    <h1>Introducing Torula 2.0</h1>

    <p>Channel wise we has over 800+ channels including international.
      The only major US channels missing are CBS and ABC.
      We may be adding a kodi addon down the road,
      but for now on a fire stick you can use amazon silk
      browser to load torula or on safari or chrome or edge.</p>

    <p>We extended the free trial to 5 days while we work out all the kinks.
      If you have any issues please let us know here.</p>

    <p>We only accept crypto for payments to protect everyone involved including you.
      To top off your membership just click "New transaction" from the transactions page.</p>

    <p>Torula works in Safari on iOS and Chrome on android. All other major desktop browsers work.
      On firetv you can install amazon silk browser and on
      samsung tv (2016+) you can use their "internet browser" which I believe is firefox.
      Also tested on chrome on nvidia shield with iPhone mouse app.</p>
